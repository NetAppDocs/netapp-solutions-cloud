EDITED This section covers the steps to setup SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware.

== Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before you get started:

. For registering the vCenter server while deploying the OVA, specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IP address of the vCenter.

. For the vCenter credentials, use an account with minimum required privileges

. Open firewall ports for vCenter Server access. 

. Update the Security Group of the Amazon VPC where FSx for ONTAP is running to allow SCV access to FSx for ONTAP. 

NOTE: SCV is available free of charge.

== Setting up the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware

To protect VMs and NFS/iSCSI-based datastores hosting them, SCV must be deployed. It's a simple OVF import. 

The steps to deploy are as follows:

. Download the OVA from link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/scpivs44_download_the_ova_open_virtual_appliance.html[NetApp Support Site].

. Log in to the Amazon EVS vCenter.

. Within vCenter, right-click any inventory object such as a data center, folder, cluster, or host and select "Deploy OVF template".

. Select the correct settings, including storage, segment and customize the template to update the vCenter and its credentials, create SCV credentials and IP details. Once reviewed, select "Finish".

. Wait for the OVF import and deployment tasks to complete.

. Once SCV is successfully deployed, it will be registered within vCenter.

. To access the plug-in, navigate to the left sidebar of the vCenter web client page, select "SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware".
