The following section shows how to restore guest files and folders from VMDKs.

NOTE: SnapCenter supports file and folder restoration from VMDKs only when the guest operating system is Windows.

Considerations for guest file and folder restoration with SCV:

* VMware tools must be running on the VM.
* The attached VMDK is accessible for 24 hours by default.
* Only one restore or attach operation can be performed on a virtual machine at a time.
* System, hidden, and encrypted files can be restored; however, their original attributes will not be preserved.
* Avoid restoring encrypted files to encrypted folders or overwriting system files.

Steps for the guest file and folder restoration:

. Right-click the target VM and select "NetApp SnapCenter > Guest File Restore".

* Guest VM Option: Attach the disk to the original VM (requires pre-configured credentials). This is the option used in this demonstration.
+
* Proxy VM Option: Attach the disk to a designated proxy VM (must be configured in advance).

. Wait for the attach operation to finish before browsing and restoring files. Once the operation completes, SnapCenter automatically creates a guest file restore session.
