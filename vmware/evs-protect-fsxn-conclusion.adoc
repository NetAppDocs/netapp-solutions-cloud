EDITED In this document, we provided detailed step by step guidance of deploying, configuring, and using SCV and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-scsql/concept_snapcenter_plug_in_for_microsoft_sql_server_overview.html[SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server (SCSQL)] while using FSx for ONTAP as the supplemental datastore with Amazon EVS clusters. 

== Conclusion

To summarize, when using FSx for ONTAP to optimize TCO for an Amazon EVS deployment, SCV offers a simple and efficient method for backing up VMs. It can back up and restore VMs in a seamless and quick manner since it relies on Snapshot copies, which take literally seconds to complete.
