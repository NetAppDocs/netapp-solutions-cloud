This section outlines how to delete backups and restores of  Apps in OpenShift container platform using Velero.

== List all backups
You can list all Backup CRs by using the OC CLI tool or the Velero CLI tool.
Download the Velero CLI as given in the instructions in the link:https://velero.io/docs/v1.3.0/basic-install/#install-the-cli[Velero documentation].

== Deleting a backup

You can delete a Backup CR without deleting the Object Storage data by using the OC CLI tool. The backup will be removed from the CLI/Console output. However, since the corresponding backup is not removed from the object storage, it will re-appear in the CLI/console output.

**If you want to delete the Backup CR AND the associated object storage data, you can do so by using the Velero CLI tool.**
